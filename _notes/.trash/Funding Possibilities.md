[Faculty of Surgical Trainers/ASME Educational Research Grant 2023 - ASME](https://www.asme.org.uk/awards/fst-rsch-grnt-2023/)


**Application deadline:**

 - [x] **Friday, 30 June 2023 (17:00 BST)**

**Award available:**

Funding will be limited for up to **£3,000.** Applications seeking funding above this level of support will not be considered by the Research Committee. Please note that the funds cannot be used for personal salary costs, travel, or the acquisition of computing facilities.

**Who is it for?**

Surgical Trainees and Consultants who are Members of the FST and/or ASME, in good standing.

**Period/length of funding**

Funding will only cover up to one year of the research project.

**What activities can be supported?**

The small educational research grants are intended to support evaluation or research into surgical education and training. Projects should either lead directly to improvements in surgical education/training practice or increase our understanding of an aspect of surgical education/training.

Please note that requests for running costs to support established projects will be less favourably reviewed than those for pilot work that has the potential to facilitate applications for more substantial funding in the future.


# AMEE Research Grants
[Research Grants](https://amee.org/AMEE/Grants/Research_Grants_Landing.aspx?hkey=088d34d5-4f94-437f-9b39-3a57051895df&WebsiteKey=71c038c0-590a-47ba-a2ce-45292b48a1cc)
The AMEE Research Grants programme recognises the importance of research in health professions education, and aims to promote excellence in research among AMEE members. Open to current paid Individual and Student Members, either the Principal, or one of the Associate Investigators of the research project must hold an AMEE membership.  
  
The Grants provide financial support of up to £10,000 for educational research projects, with the aim of promoting scholarship in healthcare professions education.  

Information about the 2023 Research Grant will be posted on the website shortly. Please email services@amee.org for further information.

## The Award

The grant is an award of up to £10,000 intended to provide additional support for projects in the field of health professions education. This funding may be used to cover expenses incurred in the course of conducting research such as standardised patient fees, incentives for study participants, transcription fees, salary support for a research assistant and meetings of the research group.   
It cannot be used to provide salary support for the core team, equipment, travel (other than research group meetings), or institutional overhead costs.

## How to Apply

To apply for a Research Grant, you need to submit a pre-proposal outlining your project. To do this, complete the application form and return it by email to services@amee.org before the deadline.   
  
The pre-proposal application form includes:  

-   Title of your proposal
-   Details of the Principal investigator: institution, address, contact details
-   Proposed start and end date (max. 1 year)
-   A Summary of the project (1000 words total)
-   Problem statement/topic/issue/relevance
-   Conceptual framework/theoretical framework
-   Research question(s)
-   Description of proposed design and methods (at least 1/3 of your summary should address this area)
-   Budget and Justification  
      
    Applicants will be informed of the decision on their proposal, and if selected will be invited to submit a full proposal.  
    

## Selection Criteria and Review Process

The grant review consists of two levels. Your Pre-proposal is initially reviewed by the committee who decide whether it is suitable for funding through AMEE. If successful you will be invited to submit a full proposal. The second level review then looks closely at your full proposal, based on the criteria below. Please be aware that feedback will only be provided to author(s) who are invited to submit a full proposal.  
  
Proposals are assessed on the basis of:  
• Theoretical importance  
• Innovation  
• A clear problem statement (how the problem will be addressed), and research question  
• The rigor of methodological approach  
• Practical and theoretical significance  
• Publication suitability (i.e. to what extent will the outcomes of the project result in a publishable report in a peer reviewed scientific journal?)  
• Ethical value (please outline the ethical consent requirements and process of the study context, and how the team will address these)  
• Feasibility within the 1 year time frame for completion  
• The expertise and relevant research experience of the project team (i.e. expertise of the team in the area of investigation, and appropriate disciplines of the research team).   
• A realistic plan for results (to include required presentation at AMEE meeting and likelihood of publishing findings in medical education literature)  
• The style of writing and clarity of the proposal  
  
Successful applicants will be invited to present the results of their study at the AMEE Conference (within 3 years of receipt of funding).

# ASME Small Grants 2023
[Small Grants 2023 - ASME](https://www.asme.org.uk/awards/small-grants-2023/)
The Association for the Study of Medical Education (ASME), which includes in its goals, the promotion of high-quality research into medical education, invites **ASME Members (including undergraduate student members and employees of institutions that are members of the Association)** to submit a bid for a small grant to support a research study in the field of medical or other healthcare education. **ASME welcomes submissions from new as well as established researchers. ASME particularly welcomes applicants from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds.**

Some educational research projects require modest amounts of funding to cover expenses such as focus group attendance, travel, and simulated patient fees. These grants are intended to assist such projects. The grants are not intended to supplement the natural support that institutions should give to individuals and therefore cannot be used to pay course fees, computing equipment, overheads, research assistants/associates and similar. The grants may be used for transcription costs, however, these cannot exceed £16.00 per hour. Small Grant funding must not be used for conference attendance.

All recipients of the Small Grants award will be contractually obligated to produce an end-of-project report to the ASME Board and to make, via open licence, any teaching/learning resource produced, available via ASME’s website to its membership.

The maximum award per individual or project under the scheme will be £5,000 or equivalent (bids for smaller amounts of funding are welcomed and encouraged). Successful applicants will be invited to submit an application for presentation at the Annual Scholarship Meeting (ASM) after their project has been completed. Please note that registration, travel and accommodation for the ASM are NOT covered by this award.

Applications

Applications should be made via the online submission form. Your submission should be no more than 500 words (excluding references) and **clearly** outline:

1.  Brief critique of background literature and justified need for the project
2.  Description of project including:
    1.  Aim and research question(s)
    2.  Justification for the choice of methodology
    3.  Projected outcomes
    4.  Timetable to start in mid-2023 and ideally to finish within 6 month timescale
3.  Costed justification of funding required

If the above criteria are not met, then the submission will be rejected due to the instructions not being adhered to.  The Education Research Committee may ask for a more detailed proposal from those short-listed.

We particularly welcome applicants from diverse and under-represented backgrounds.

Applicants should refer to our [FAQ](https://www.asme.org.uk/awards/faqs/) page to answer most questions about ASME award submissions
