## Highlights
- This is what time travel is. It’s looking at a person, and seeing them in the present and the past, concurrently. And that mode of transport only worked with those one had known a significant time. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=451))
- His brain was treacherously negative. He would invent that she had been cold toward him, that she hadn’t even had a class that day, that she had simply wanted to get away from Sam. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=485))
- “You’re incredibly gifted, Sam. But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it.” ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=509))
- Sadie liked the phrase “an abundance of caution.” It reminded her of a murder of crows, a flock of seagulls, a pack of wolves. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=554))
- I can wait until you’re dead.” ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=581))
- “There is no more intimate act than play, even sex.” The internet responded: no one who had had good sex would ever say that, and there must be something seriously wrong with Sam. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=691))
- The mazes were for Sadie. To design a game is to imagine the person who will eventually play it. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=705))
- This life is filled with inescapable moral compromises. We should do what we can to avoid the easy ones.” ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=728))
- Sadie didn’t know why she bothered. You would think women would want to stick together when there weren’t that many of them, but they never did. It was as if being a woman was a disease that you didn’t wish to catch. As long as you didn’t associate with the other women, you could imply to the majority, the men: I’m not like those other ones. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=773))
- “Always remember, mine Sadie: life is very long, unless it is not.” ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1042))
- These, of course, are the kinds of vows young people feel comfortable making when they have no idea what life has in store for them. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1342))
- But this was classic Sam—he had learned to tolerate the sometimes-painful present by living in the future. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1383))
- cicerone ([Location 1388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1388))
- There is a time for any fledgling artist where one’s taste exceeds one’s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anyway. ([Location 1439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1439))
- “The game character, like the self, is contextual.” In Koreatown, no one ever thought Sam was Korean. In Manhattan, no one had ever thought he was white. In Los Angeles, he was the “white cousin.” In New York, he was that “little Chinese kid.” And yet, in K-town, he felt more Korean than he ever had before. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1645))
- Rube Goldberg machine. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1677))
- “And this is the truth of any game—it can only exist at the moment that it is being played. It’s the same with being an actor. In the end, all we can ever know is the game that was played, in the only world that we know.” ([Location 1688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1688))
- Marx was great at being in love, for a bit, and certainly, no one ever left a relationship with Marx feeling abused or hurt. ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1859))
- He had the gift of letting people think it was their idea to end the relationship, thereby converting most of his ex-lovers into friends. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1860))
- Marx could not set foot in Harvard Square without running into an ex, and usually, that person was happy to see him. ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1862))
- Sam’s grandfather had two core beliefs: (1) all things were knowable by anyone, and (2) anything was fixable if you took the time to figure out what was broken. ([Location 1932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=1932))
- The statue leaped to the ground, improbably landing faceup, with a percussive splat and an explosion of red blood that suggested a Jackson Pollock painting, in process, more than it did a suicide. ([Location 2106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=2106))
- It wasn’t much then. A glimmer of a notion of a nothing of a whisper of a figment of an idea. ([Location 2611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=2611))
- She tasted like cinnamon tea and mandarin oranges, and he wanted to have sex with her, but he could tell she was still in the middle of work. ([Location 2755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=2755))
- It isn’t a sadness, but a joy, that we don’t do the same things for the length of our lives.” ([Location 4002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4002))
- And at some point, there would be children, and Sam would become sad bachelor uncle Sam, expected to give presents for birthdays and holidays. ([Location 4212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4212))
- He had had years to contemplate the puzzle of himself. And now the old puzzle would be replaced with a new puzzle: ([Location 4222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4222))
- How do I go on when the person I love most in the world is in love with someone else? Someone tell me the solution, he thought, so I don’t have to play this losing game all the way through. ([Location 4223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4223))
- you guys want to go see the Hearst Castle? ([Location 4419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4419))
- La Cuesta Encantada, the most quixotic, stately pleasure dome in California, ([Location 4420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4420))
- “Because he’s boring.” Sam shrugged, as if Marx’s banality was an indisputable fact. “That’s why he’s always dating someone new. He gets bored with people, but it’s not about them, it’s because he’s boring.” ([Location 4448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4448))
- Sam used to say that Marx was the most fortunate person he had ever met—he was lucky with lovers, in business, in looks, in life. But the longer Sadie knew Marx, the more she thought Sam hadn’t truly understood the nature of Marx’s good fortune. Marx was fortunate because he saw everything as if it were a fortuitous bounty. It was impossible to know—were persimmons his favorite fruit, or had they just now become his favorite fruit because there they were, growing in his own backyard? ([Location 4610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4610))
- “I’m feeling Torschlusspanik,” Simon said. He was the one driving, while Ant tried to catch some extra sleep. ([Location 4634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4634))
- Zweisamkeit’ is the feeling of being alone even when you’re with other people.” ([Location 4686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4686))
- I felt it so often that I thought this was the nature of living. To be alive was to accept that you were fundamentally alone.” ([Location 4688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=4688))
- It is strange, you think, how much people hate going to doctors, but how much they love watching shows about doctors. ([Location 5012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5012))
- Using a long needle, she is stringing brightly colored origami cranes into garlands. You know what she’s doing: It’s a Japanese custom called senbazuru. If you make one thousand paper cranes, you can restore someone to good health. ([Location 5104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5104))
- The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time. ([Location 5139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5139))
- “What is a game?” Marx said. “It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.” ([Location 5678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5678))
- It begins to seem to me that life is little more than a series of losses, and as you must know by now, I hate losing. ([Location 5911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5911))
- “And what is love, in the end?” Alabaster said. “Except the irrational desire to put evolutionary competitiveness aside in order to ease someone else’s journey through life?” ([Location 5962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5962))
- “The boredom you speak of,” Alabaster said. “It is what most of us call happiness.” ([Location 5995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5995))
- Alabaster rolled their lilac eyes. “You are happy, and you are bored. You need to find a new pastime.” ([Location 5997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=5997))
- Sadie had willed herself to be great: art doesn’t typically get made by happy people. ([Location 6314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=6314))
- This generation doesn’t hide anything from anyone. My class talks a lot about their traumas. And how their traumas inform their games. They, honest to God, think their traumas are the most interesting thing about them. I sound like I’m making fun, and I am a little, but I don’t mean to be. ([Location 6590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=6590))
- We wouldn’t have made Ichigo Japanese, because we would have worried about the fact that we weren’t Japanese. ([Location 6604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LH8HSXJ&location=6604))
