## Highlights
- I write these words in steel, for anything not set in metal cannot be trusted. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000UZQI0Q&location=108))
- That was one nice thing about books and notes. They could always wait for another time. ([Location 2981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000UZQI0Q&location=2981))
- He found insanity no excuse, however, for irrational behavior. Some men were blind, others had poor tempers. Still others heard voices. It was all the same, in the end. A man was defined not by his flaws, but by how he overcame them. ([Location 3185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000UZQI0Q&location=3185))
- massive chest muscles. Sazed could see little trails of red blood ([Location 3363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000UZQI0Q&location=3363))
- Love must be allowed to flow both ways—if it is not, then it is not truly love, I think. It is something else. Infatuation, perhaps? Either way, there are some of us who are far too quick to make martyrs of ourselves. We stand at the side, watching, thinking that we do the right thing by inaction. We fear pain—our own, or that of another.” ([Location 8757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000UZQI0Q&location=8757))
- “At first glance, the key and the lock it fits may seem very different,” Sazed said. “Different in shape, different in function, different in design. The man who looks at them without knowledge of their true nature might think them opposites, for one is meant to open, and the other to keep closed. Yet, upon closer examination, he might see that without one, the other becomes useless. The wise man then sees that both lock and key were created for the same purpose.” ([Location 8809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000UZQI0Q&location=8809))
