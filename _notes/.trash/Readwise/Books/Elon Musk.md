## Highlights
- Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to … well … save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=254))
- “I think the time allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,” Musk said. “I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to ten—how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe ten hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.” ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=272))
- “He goes into his brain, and then you just see he is in another world,” Maye said. “He still does that. Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something.” ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=443))
- (He picked Queen’s over the University of Waterloo because he felt there were more good-looking women at Queen’s.) ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=662))
- Outside of his studies, Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal, and the two of them would identify interesting people they would like to meet. They then took turns cold-calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch. ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=664))
- “He went back to the professor, and talked his way into the two points he lost and got a hundred,” Justine said. “It felt like we were always competing. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=696))
- When the video game Civilization was released, the college chums spent hours building their empire, much to the dismay of Farooq’s girlfriend, who was forgotten in another room. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=715))
- “That’s my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.” ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=1309))
- “Cows have this natural defense mechanism where they gather and start running in a circle,” Hollman said. “Every time we fired an engine, the cows scattered and then got in that circle with the younger ones placed in the middle. We set up a cow cam to watch them.” ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=1711))
- Respites, as far as they existed, came around 8 P.M. on some weeknights when Musk would allow everyone to use their work computers to play first-person-shooter video games like Quake III Arena and Counter-Strike against each other. ([Location 1757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=1757))
- ‘The longer you wait to fire someone the longer it has been since you should have fired them,’” Spikes ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=1830))
- One of my favorite things about Elon is his ability to make enormous decisions very quickly. That is still how it works today.” ([Location 3237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=3237))
- The guiding principle at SpaceX is to embrace your work and get stuff done. People who await guidance or detailed instructions languish. The same goes for workers who crave feedback. ([Location 3294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=3294))
- What do I do? Create artificial adversity? How do you do that? The biggest battle I have is restricting their video game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to read more than they play video games. They also can’t play completely stupid video games. There’s one game they downloaded recently called Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. ([Location 4914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SIDCSWY&location=4914))
