## Highlights
- He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as emotional as a bagpipe. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=71))
- We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=74))
- it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back-garden and the family have to change their name. No, sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask." ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=99))
- Hyde." ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=112))
    - Note: first mention of hyde
- "He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn't specify the point. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=114))
- Damon and Pythias." ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=162))
    - Note: Die Bürgschaft
- "If he be Mr. Hyde," he had thought, "I shall be Mr. Seek." ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=188))
- Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=228))
- or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=232))
    - Note: what story?
- for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan's signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend." ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=233))
- PEDE CLAUDO, ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=259))
- kindled ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=355))
- face, smoothed by hypocrisy; ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=362))
- "Edward Hyde": ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=417))
- But the room was gay with firelight. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=443))
- No, sir; master's made away with; he was made, away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and who's in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson!" ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=629))
- but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer's emotion had broken loose. "For God's sake," he had added, "find me some of the old." ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=645))
    - Note: ückfall, Temperament , split-personality
- that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll." ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=823))
- These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=837))
- were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the ([Location 859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=859))
- "And now," said he, "to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it shall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan." ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=889))
- "O God!" I screamed, and "O God!" again and again; for there before my eyes—pale and shaken, and half-fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death— there stood Henry Jekyll! ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=903))
- With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=928))
    - Note: split personality
- If each, I told myself, could but be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust delivered from the aspirations might go his way, and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=936))
- I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=945))
- Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=957))
- I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde. ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=968))
- Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter, and younger than Henry Jekyll. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=972))
- Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) ([Location 973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=973))
    - Note: Freud
- This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil. ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=978))
- Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1031))
- How was this to be explained? I asked myself, and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be remedied? ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1031))
- Jekyll had more than a father's interest; Hyde had more than a son's indifference. ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1052))
- I was once more Edward Hyde. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1108))
- He, I say—I cannot say, I. ([Location 1129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1129))
- It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1135))
- I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1148))
- the horror of my other self. ([Location 1149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1149))
- that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1156))
- and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1170))
- God knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1179))
- I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00HFXRC06&location=1181))
