## Highlights
- the ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in. ([Location 1816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00L2EQODK&location=1816))
- The physical universe was a language with a perfectly ambiguous grammar. Every physical event was an utterance that could be parsed in two entirely different ways, one causal and the other teleological, both valid, neither one disqualifiable no matter how much context was available. ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00L2EQODK&location=1938))
- Like physical events, with their causal and teleological interpretations, every linguistic event had two possible interpretations: as a transmission of information and as the realization of a plan. ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00L2EQODK&location=2034))
