## Highlights
- If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining? ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0165X8WN2&location=333))
- Because the brain mediates our experience of the world, any neurosurgical problem forces a patient and family, ideally with a doctor as a guide, to answer this question: What makes life meaningful enough to go on living? ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0165X8WN2&location=671))
- I came to believe that it is irresponsible to be more precise than you can be accurate. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0165X8WN2&location=877))
- But if I did not know what I wanted, I had learned something, something not found in Hippocrates, Maimonides, or Osler: the physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence. ([Location 1447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0165X8WN2&location=1447))
- When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing. ([Location 1729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0165X8WN2&location=1729))
