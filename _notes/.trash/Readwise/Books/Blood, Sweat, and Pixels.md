## Highlights
- “Sounds like a miracle that this game was even made,” I said. “Oh, Jason,” he said. “It’s a miracle that any game is made.” ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=46))
- Here’s an alternative theory: every single video game is made under abnormal circumstances. Video games straddle the border between art and technology in a way that was barely possible just a few decades ago. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=71))
- Urquhart pointed out that making games is sort of like shooting movies, if you had to build an entirely new camera every time you started. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=87))
- Every game is delayed at least once. Every game developer must make tough compromises. Every company must sweat over which hardware and technology to use. Every studio must build its schedules around big trade shows like E3, where developers will draw motivation (and even feedback) from throngs of excited fans. And, most controversially, everyone who makes video games has to crunch, sacrificing personal lives and family time for a job that seems to never end. ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=108))
- “I wish I was more of a sociopath or psychopath and I could just completely ignore the fact that there’s this guillotine pointed at my neck all the time. But I can’t. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=154))
- The standard burn rate for a game studio was $10,000 per person per month, a number that included both salaries and overhead costs, like health insurance and office rent. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=173))
- Naughty Dog, like many experienced studios, bought into the mentality that there was no way to know whether part of a game was fun until you played it. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=743))
- ‘Perfect is the enemy of good,’” said the writer Josh Scherr. “You’re polishing something that’s at ninety-five percent while this thing over here at sixty percent needs a lot of love. So that was what made crunch hard, because [when] you’d get down into it, you’d have trouble seeing the forest for the trees.” ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=910))
- “The money has made relationships complicated,” Edmund McMillen, the designer of the platformer Super Meat Boy, told Parkin. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=1250))
- “The biggest differentiator between a studio that creates a really high-quality game and a studio that doesn’t isn’t the quality of the team,” said one person who worked on Destiny. “It’s their dev tools. If you can take fifty shots on goal, and you’re a pretty shitty hockey player, and I can only take three shots on goal and I’m Wayne fucking Gretzky, you’re probably going to do better. That’s what tools are. It’s how fast can you iterate, how stable are they, how robust are they, how easy is it as a nontechnical artist to move a thing.” ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NAKSWW1&location=2976))
