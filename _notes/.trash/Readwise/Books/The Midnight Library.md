## Highlights
- She couldn’t even manage ‘cat owner’. Or ‘one-hour-a-week piano tutor’. Or ‘human capable of conversation ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=399))

- A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=720))
- She stepped outside, wondering whether a life could really be judged from just a few minutes after midnight on a Tuesday. Or maybe that was all you needed. ([Location 760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=760))
- At university she had done an essay drily titled ‘The Principles of Hobbesian Memory and Imagination’. Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=810))
- Do you? Or is this maze just for me? ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=902))
- ‘Want,’ she told her, in a measured tone, ‘is an interesting word. It means lack. Sometimes if we fill that lack with something else the original want disappears entirely. Maybe you have a lack problem rather than a want problem. Maybe there is a life that you really want to live.’ ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=930))
- ‘Well, you don’t see yourself as a bad cat owner any more. You looked after him as well as he could have been looked after. He loved you as much as you loved him, and maybe he didn’t want you to see him die. You see, cats know. They understand when their time is up. He went outside because he was going to die, and he knew it.’ ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=983))
- ‘So, you see? Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .’ She searched for the appropriate term and found it. ‘A load of bullshit.’ ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=995))
- ‘Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.’ ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=1000))
- The lonely mind in the busy city yearns for connection because it thinks human-to-human connection is the point of everything. But amid pure nature (or the ‘tonic of wildness’ as Thoreau called it) solitude took on a different character. It became in itself a kind of connection. A connection between herself and the world. And between her and herself. ([Location 1837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=1837))
- Moment of Extreme Crisis in the Middle of Nowhere ‘Oh fuck,’ whispered Nora, into the cold. ([Location 1876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=1876))
- Maybe that’s what all lives were, though. Maybe even the most seemingly perfectly intense or worthwhile lives ultimately felt the same. Acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty. Maybe that was the only meaning that mattered. To be the world, witnessing itself. ([Location 1955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=1955))

- ‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’ ([Location 2034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2034))
- ‘It’s like how humans never see the second hand of a clock mid-tick,’ said Nora. ([Location 2107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2107))
- ‘Exquisite, charming, intelligent, beautiful. Much like now.’ She laughed it off. ‘Stop being so French.’ ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2126))

- ‘But you will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life,’ he said, wisely. ([Location 2147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2147))
- There was something equally annoying and attractive about Hugo. He exuded an arrogant amorality that made his face something to either slap or kiss, depending on the circumstances. ([Location 2151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2151))
- may have not been sure about what really did interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn’t. ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2166))
- ‘If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there’? ([Location 2168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2168))
- It seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren’t really thinking. ([Location 2193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2193))
- There is no rejection, there is only redirection. ([Location 2377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2377))

- It’s like early Cure fused with Frank Ocean via The Carpenters and Tame Impala.’ Nora tried, and failed, to imagine what that could possibly sound like. ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2511))
- ‘I think it is easy to imagine there are easier paths,’ ([Location 2523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2523))
- ‘But maybe there are no easy paths. There are just paths. In one life, I might be married. In another, I might be working in a shop. I might have said yes to this cute guy who asked me out for a coffee. In another I might be researching glaciers in the Arctic Circle. In another, I might be an Olympic swimming champion. Who knows? ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2524))
- Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.’ ([Location 2526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2526))
- It is so easy, while trapped in just the one life, to imagine that times of sadness or tragedy or failure or fear are a result of that particular existence. That it is a by-product of living a certain way, rather than simply living. ([Location 2530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2530))
- But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.’ ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2533))
- ‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things.’ ([Location 2743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2743))

- In that life she had a book of Emily Dickinson poems beside her bed and she had a playlist called ‘Extreme States of Euphoria’ and another one called ‘The Glue to Fix Me When I Am Broken’. ([Location 2956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2956))
- It was as though she had reached some state of acceptance about life – that if there was a bad experience, there wouldn’t only be bad experiences. ([Location 2995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2995))
- She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery. ([Location 2996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2996))
- ‘We only know what we perceive. Everything we experience is ultimately just our perception of it. “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”’ ([Location 3049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=3049))
