- “I ain’t grouchy,” Teft snapped. “I just have a low threshold for stupidity.” ([Location 9889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DA6YEKS&location=9889))
- Just his dignity. Too late, Kaladin thought, watching Adolin sit back with a stupid grin on his face. That’s dead and burned already. ([Location 12896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DA6YEKS&location=12896))
