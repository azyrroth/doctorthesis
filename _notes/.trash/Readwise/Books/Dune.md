## Highlights
- “Once, men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.” ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=300))
- Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind,’” ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=301))
- A world is supported by four things….” She held up four big-knuckled fingers. “…the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing….” She closed her fingers into a fist. “…without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!” ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=646))
- because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.

- From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.” ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=1371))

- Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.

- “Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear’s path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” ([Location 4305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=4305))
- What do you despise? By this are you truly known. ([Location 4308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=4308))
- The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future. ([Location 5995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=5995))
- Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic. ([Location 6909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00B7NPRY8&location=6909))
