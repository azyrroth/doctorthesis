## Highlights
- like infernal fire, grief burns but does not consume; instead, it makes the heart vulnerable to further suffering. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=415))
- “Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity,” ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=429))
- “Coincidence and intention are two sides of a tapestry, my lord. You may find one more agreeable to look at, but you cannot say one is true and the other is false.” ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=455))
- past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only know them more fully. My journey to the past had changed nothing, but what I had learned had changed everything, and I understood that it could not have been otherwise. If our lives are tales that Allah tells, then we are the audience as well as the players, and it is by living these tales that we receive their lessons. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=503))
- Nothing erases the past. There is repentance, there is atonement, and there is forgiveness. That is all, but that is enough. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=517))
- The end state is akinetic mutism, a kind of waking coma. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=816))
- akinetic mutism was very rare, a result of damage to the anterior cingulate region of the brain. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=818))
- People used to speculate about a thought that destroys the thinker, some unspeakable Lovecraftian horror, or a Gödel sentence that crashes the human logical system. It turns out that the disabling thought is one that we’ve all encountered: the idea that free will doesn’t exist. It just wasn’t harmful until you believed it. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=819))
- Pretend that you have free will. It’s essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you know they don’t. The reality isn’t important; what’s important is your belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma. Civilization now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has. ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=831))
- It’s no coincidence that “aspiration” means both hope and the act of breathing. When we speak, we use the breath in our lungs to give our thoughts a physical form. The sounds we make are simultaneously our intentions and our life force. I speak, therefore I am. Vocal learners, like parrots and humans, are perhaps the only ones who fully comprehend the truth of this. ([Location 3266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3266))
- But you can also think of it as a barely audible reverberation of that original “om.” ([Location 3281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3281))
- When Arecibo is not listening to anything else, it hears the voice of ([Location 3282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3282))
- Then I told them that, while trees without growth rings and men without navels are wondrous and surprising, they are also logically necessary. ([Location 3345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3345))
- would mean that you had created evidence of summers and winters that never took place. That would be a deception, no different than if you had given a primordial man a scar on his brow as a remnant of an injury suffered during a childhood he never experienced. ([Location 3347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3347))
- Let me always be inquisitive, but never be suspicious. Amen. ([Location 3465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3465))
- But for me, science is the true modern cathedral, an edifice of knowledge every bit as majestic as anything made of stone. ([Location 3491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3491))
- “Science is not just the search for the truth,” he said. “It’s the search for purpose.” ([Location 3661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3661))
- If humanity is the central fact of the universe, if our species is the omphalos, then a close examination of the celestial sphere should confirm that privileged status. Our solar system should be the fixed point against which all else is moving; ([Location 3689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3689))
- because what happened in that moment was not a necessary consequence of what preceded it. That primordial clamshell that Wilhelmina keeps with her is indeed proof of something: not of God’s plans for humanity, but of the existence of miracles. That border where the growth rings end marks the limit of physical law’s explanatory power. And that is something we can take inspiration from. ([Location 3726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3726))
- Free will is a kind of miracle; when we make a genuine choice, we bring about a result that cannot be reduced to the workings of physical law. ([Location 3730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3730))
- Every act of volition is, like the creation of the universe, a first cause. ([Location 3731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3731))
- Even if humanity is not the reason for which the universe was made, I still wish to understand the way it operates. We human beings may not be the answer to the question why, but I will keep looking for the answer to how. ([Location 3747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3747))
- This search is my purpose; not because you chose it for me, Lord, but because I chose it for myself. ([Location 3749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3749))
- In 1978, the physicist Michael Berry calculated that you could predict only nine collisions before you would need to account for the gravitational effect of a person standing in the room. If your initial measurement of a ball’s position is off by even a nanometer, your prediction becomes useless within a matter of seconds. ([Location 3947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=3947))
- Clearly Vinessa hadn’t gotten there yet, and maybe it was because in Dana she had found someone willing to accept the blame. Dana had done something shitty to Vinessa, no doubt about it, but that was years ago. If Vinessa hadn’t gotten her act together by now, it was her own fault, not Dana’s. ([Location 4305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4305))
- Edgar Allan Poe had used the phrase “the imp of the perverse” to describe the temptation to do the wrong thing simply because you could, and for many people the imp had become more persuasive. ([Location 4330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4330))

- some version of him was going to pull the trigger, so why shouldn’t it be him? ([Location 4532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4532))
- “But the question was, given that we know about other branches, whether making good choices is worth doing. I think it absolutely is. None of us are saints, but we can all try to be better. Each time you do something generous, ([Location 4578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4578))
- “And it’s not just your behavior in this branch that you’re changing: you’re inoculating all the versions of you that split off in the future. By becoming a better person, you’re ensuring that more and more of the branches that split off from this point forward are populated by better versions of you.” ([Location 4580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4580))
- But I imagined what a better person might do, and I did that instead. “I feel good about what I did, but it’s not like I deserve a medal or anything. Because there are other people for whom being generous comes easily, without a struggle. And it’s easy for them because in the past they made a lot of little decisions to be generous. It was hard for me because I’ve made a lot of little decisions to be selfish in the past. ([Location 4680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4680))
- If the same thing happens in branches where you acted differently, then you aren’t the cause. ([Location 4718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4718))
- I thought that a Muslim setting might work, because acceptance of fate is one of the basic articles of faith in Islam. ([Location 4741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4741))
- In effect, we are consuming order and generating disorder; we live by increasing the disorder of the universe. It’s only because the universe started in a highly ordered state that we are able to exist at all. ([Location 4752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4752))
- Sex isn’t what makes a relationship real; the willingness to expend effort maintaining it is. ([Location 4772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4772))
- Having a real relationship, whether with a lover or a child or a pet, requires that you be willing to balance the other party’s wants and needs with your own. ([Location 4775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4775))
- So while achieving legal rights for AIs would be a major step, another milestone that would be just as important is people putting real effort into their individual relationships with AIs. ([Location 4778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4778))
- No matter whether we want AIs to fill the role of employees, lovers, or pets, I suspect they will do a better job if, during their development, there were people who cared about them. ([Location 4782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4782))
- a lot of people say that for an action of yours to be freely chosen—for you to bear moral responsibility for that action—you must have had the ability to do something else under exactly the same circumstances. ([Location 4842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4842))
- we say that an individual’s character is revealed by the choices they make over time, then, in a similar fashion, an individual’s character would also be revealed by the choices they make across many worlds. ([Location 4852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GD46PQZ&location=4852))
