## Highlights
- The school of creative misdirection. Very good, my lady.” ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=1592))
- hard times make people willing to accept a man who preaches change.” ([Location 1932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=1932))
- is human nature to believe that other places and other times are better than the here and now. ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=2042))
- it was beneficial to have a reputation for honesty, if only so that one could lie at crucial moments. ([Location 2079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=2079))
- desperate people do things completely out of character. ([Location 2436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=2436))
- “Do not dash if you only have the strength to walk, and do not waste your time pushing on walls that will not give. ([Location 2781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=2781))
- Pain lost its power when other things became more important. Kahar didn’t need a potion or an Aon to save him—he just needed something to do. ([Location 3891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=3891))
- “Remember, the past need not become our future as well.” ([Location 3936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=3936))
- Sometimes we must fall, sometimes we will rise—some must be hurt while others have fortune, for that is the only way we can learn to rely on one another. As one is blessed, it is his privilege to help those whose lives are not as easy. Unity often springs from strife, child.” ([Location 4250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=4250))
- “We can be strong in the face of kings and priests, my lady,” Ashe replied, “but to live is to have worries and uncertainties. Keep them inside, and they will destroy you for certain—leaving behind a person so callused that emotion can find no root in your heart.” ([Location 5235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=5235))
- you optimists just can’t understand that a depressed person doesn’t want you to try and cheer them up. It makes us sick.” ([Location 6202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=6202))
- Kiin let her in, then held her as she fell into his arms. It was a perfectly humiliating end to a very emotional day. However, the hug was worth it. She had decided as a child that her uncle was very good at hugging, his broad arms and enormous chest sufficient to envelop even a tall and gangly girl. ([Location 6743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=6743))
- Joy was more than just an absence of discomfort. ([Location 6828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=6828))
- “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone, male or female, that’s quite as opinionated as you are.” ([Location 7473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=7473))
- “You’re an excellent judge of character, Sarene—except your own. Often our own opinions of ourselves are the most unrealistic. ([Location 7528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=7528))
- Hoid,” ([Location 9770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=9770))
- There was nothing he could do. If he stopped the execution, the army would turn against him, and he might very well face his own execution. All he could do was watch as the headman raised his weapon. The general closed his eyes and swung the weapon. And missed, swinging the sword so that its tip passed less than an inch from the false Raoden’s neck. The impostor raised his head slightly as the soldiers released their ropes, letting him loose. He focused on the sword blade, blinking in confusion. General Gatrii was kneeling on the ground before Raoden, and the soldiers around the circle were following suit. “What is this?” Hrathen demanded. “It was the way Lord Eton commanded us to perform executions,” a soldier said, kneeling at his side. “You swing the sword with your eyes closed. If it hits, the man was guilty. If it misses, then he was innocent all along.” ([Location 10976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=10976))
- a vibrant, passionate story about engaging characters is more important than cool magic systems or epic action sequences. Characters and emotion are the true magic. The whisper from Elantris is a warning to me never to forget that. ([Location 11035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003G93YLY&location=11035))
