## Highlights
- The Weight of the World
  Key takeaways:
  (* Troy is a master of a thousand voices., * Ellie and Troy have a beautiful connection., * Ellie's mother is proud of her work.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Troy is a master of a thousand voices. Yes. I have been Troy's voice has been in my head across. I don't know how many games, but the thing about Troy is when you meet him, he doesn't necessarily sound like any of those people. Whereas you sound exactly like it. And it is so rattling and gorgeous. It's hard to explain, but you and Ellie are so intertwined. I see you and Ellie have this overlap that is astonishing and it's so exciting to me as a fan. Like I know people listening to you right now are like, holy shit, these three dipshits are sitting in the room with Ellie. You know? Because you, I don't know, it's just, that's why to bring it back to this opening and why I am so proud of it and why I think it works so well and it makes me cry every time I see it is because you can feel like a handoff. You can feel this beautiful connection from Ellie's mother to Ellie. There is eliness traveling through you. It's why one of my favorite little moments, I mean, we had these two babies that were fraternal twins. One was a girl, one was a boy.

- The Ethics of Trolley Problem Decision Making
  Key takeaways:
  (* Marlene is a utilitarian and this is the trolley problem writ large., * If your goal is to save as many human lives as possible, then Marlene is making the right choice.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Marlene also, her personality is she's a leader that can make the heart sacrifices for the betterment of humanity. She's constantly sending fireflies to their death, people that she's very close to. This is her first. And I think that's who she is.
  Speaker 1
  You have to be utilitarian if you're trying to achieve a goal. So back in episode five, Perry played by her beloved Jeffrey Pierce, he tells Kathleen, you're the only one who changed things. Not your brother who was the idealist. You, the utilitarian, you change things. You're the reason we're free. If Marlene is going to somehow free America and try and get back some semblance of democracy, then she has to be a utilitarian and this is the trolley problem writ large. And people have been talking about this forever. And the truth is that if your goal is to save as many human lives as possible, if that is what you believe is the morally correct thing to do, then Marlene is making the right choice. Break some eggs. But that is why the trolley problem is a problem. Yeah. You know what I mean? And people have been debating the end of the last of us since it came out 10 years ago. And I can only assume that people are debating it now. I know we sound innocent because we haven't gotten there yet. There may be riots in the streets. But people will debate this. And people may look to this podcast for some sort of answer. ([Time 0:42:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a73d9eeb-b1fc-4ac8-b5d4-5ead6edabf98))
