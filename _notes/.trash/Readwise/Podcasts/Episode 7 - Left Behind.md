## Highlights
- The Power of Ellie's Approval
  Key takeaways:
  (* Craig wanted to recapture the "photo booth moment" from Left Behind, which had a strong emotional payoff for players., * Fidelity to the experience was key for Craig, as it was for many players.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And it was like unheard of to spend that many resources on this very intimate character moment. But again, for people who experienced it, it had the same impact, the same emotional payoff, even more so of an emotional payoff than maybe an adrenaline rush. And it kind of changed, you know, how we approach things at the studios for the kind of games we make and the kind of moments we are willing to invest in. And that's why I believe Craig was like, um, so adamant from the get go that we need to recapture this moment, this photo booth moment. That was an easy one. And to try and recapture it as truly to that experience that I had playing left behind as we could. This is the back and forth we do all the time, how much fidelity, what are the things we do exactly? What are the things we change? This was one where I just thought as a fan, if I didn't see it, even down to bunny ears and monster hoses and just feeling like I remember that feeling of being physically close to a girl that I liked and she liked me and we both knew it and we were teenagers. And there's just, I don't know, man, there's just something there and, but also that moment where like you're so insecure, you can't even have enough proof. There's never enough proof to say she definitely likes me. Yeah. Not even like when her friends like, no, no, no, she likes you. But Ellie's like, okay, okay, get off.

- The Making of Mortal Kombat: Legacy
  Key takeaways:
  (* The creators of Mortal Kombat love video games and want to give everyone a chance to enjoy them, even those who haven't had the chance to experience the arcade experience., * The creators of Mortal Kombat know the moves and cheat codes because they've been told them by other players, and they're happy to share this information with the audience.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  This is one of those meta moments where there's a television show based on a video game and the guy that made the video game and the guy over here that's helping adapt the video game, both love video games and we have our whole lives and giving everybody a chance, especially I think kids who haven't known the mall arcade experience the way we have to just enjoy other people enjoying it. I think it was great. It was beautiful. And I love how Riley knows inherently that Ellie is going to love the fatality moves, the special finishers.
  Speaker 2
  For people who know Mortal Kombat, especially when you played it in 93, the only way you knew about the cheat codes or fatality codes was anecdotally, you heard the rumors because somebody in the arcade brought that up.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I'm so glad you brought that up. Because I'm sure people will watch it and be like, how do they know the moves? How do they figure out the moves? This is actually something we talked quite a lot about. ([Time 0:50:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/98322e59-4265-41e8-b786-69b65d9cd841))
