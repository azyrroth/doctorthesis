  Yeah Jesus is a wizard that's well I mean Hitler is a wizard in this world right so it's like I don't know. Anyway point being that it's really hard to go like it's really easy to stay within the Star Wars canon and tell other stories. I think it's a lot harder with Harry Potter. But anyway point being that like I think that this franchise for a lot of people has just kind of been irreversibly tainted and I'm curious to hear what you guys think of that because for me at least it's really it's going to be difficult like I'm still I don't know I have to talk to my wife for a long time about like are we going to tell her or like introduce our kids to the Harry Potter books to the Harry Potter films like is that a good thing for our kids to enjoy do we have to contextualize it in some way like for me the series have certainly been tainted in some ways even if I'm not like I will never touch anything Harry Potter again because I don't really think that way about anything it still feels like it has all this baggage attached
  Speaker 3
  So I'm curious to you guys feel like there's anything in Harry Potter worth holding on to would you be like checking out this game if not for this podcast do you think that like that that you'll like check out Harry Potter things in the future I mean well for one thing I agree with you that it's it's cool that the game is diverse because I do think a lot of just regular people will play it and won't necessarily be aware of Jake Erellings politics I do think there are people out there like that I don't know how big a percentage and so for those people I'm like yeah I would rather than play a more diverse version of Hogwarts I would rather than have that because the books don't have that no matter how you slice it so in that sense yes I think it's A net good yeah it is but also for me personally I can't divorce the baggage from Harry Potter it is tainted for me and that's just for me even leaving aside the financial aspect of it which also troubles me and and I certainly wouldn't have personally purchased this game and other than getting a review copy and covering ([TimeÂ 0:41:40](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b6a298e5-828c-4118-b59f-f1502733256a))
