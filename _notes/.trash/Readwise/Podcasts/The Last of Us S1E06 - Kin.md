## Highlights
- Die Hard
  Key takeaways:
  (* One of the listeners likes the letterbox list of movies where the theme of the movie can be summed up by the question, "Who are the real title of movie?"., * Another listener disagrees with the list because they feel that the character of Kathleen is not wellwritten.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  One of my favorite letterbox lists that I made is I made a letterbox list of movies where the theme of the movie can be summed up by the question, but who are the real title of movie? Who are the real title of movie?
  Speaker 2
  I guess I am the die-hard.
  Speaker 1
  I guess I am the real Shawshank Redimme.
  Speaker 2
  What describe me as the real green mile?

  But seriously, there's movies like Parasite on there, there's some movies for which that is actually the case. Who is the real Dune? I do want to read from Callen who wrote into decodingtv at gmail.com. Callen said, I 100% agree with Dave's take about Kathleen as a woman myself. I would love to see more unconventional female leaders depicted on screen and intrigued when I heard the showrunners discuss why they chose to write this part specifically for Melavie Linsky. I really wanted to be invested in Kathleen's character and my hope was that I'd feel some empathy for her as a complicated but capable leader who's motivated to violence out of grief and anger after her brother's death. However, I was ultimately very disappointed with the character for many of the reasons you explained. As viewers, we only see Kathleen seemingly at her worst moments. Feeling the doctor who delivered her in cold blood, hiding the dangerous underground court of steps threat from her followers, lying to fedra and forements and having them executed.
