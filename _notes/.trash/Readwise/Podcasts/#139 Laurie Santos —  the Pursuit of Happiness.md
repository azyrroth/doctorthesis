## Highlights
- "The Misconceptions We Have About Happiness"
  Key takeaways:
  (* People have misconceptions about happiness, and these misconceptions can lead to unhappiness., * People need to try more to be happy, and this does not mean that they need to do things that they think will make them happy., * The key to happiness is to find what makes you happy, and to do this, you need to be honest with yourself.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We put a ton of effort and energy into being happy, and yet so few of us actually seem happy. Why not? Like what misconceptions do we have about happiness?
  Speaker 1
  But i think it's important start with this idea that we put so much effort in right? Because i think you could sometimes think about happiness if like, oh, we're all not feeling so happy, and that's cause we're not, we're not trying. Like we need to try more. And i think that's not the problem. I think people are putting tremendous energy into the kinds of things that they think are going to make them feel good, feel successful, you know, d lead to a meaningful life. But then, even though we're putting in this much effort, we're cined an not getting anywhere. And i think the issue is that our minds, what, the way i like to talk about t on the podcast, is that our minds lie to us about the kinds of things that make us happy. We have these strong intuitions that if this would happen, i would be happiy ever after, right? Ounow, like, id have the perfect job, or if i get a higher salary, or if i get a certain acolade at work, if i become partner, or fo my students, if i get, you know, perfect grades, like, people think if those things happen, that they'll feel happier. And, you know, there's studies that look at people who get those wonderful things and, yah, you get a little happiness boast for a little while, but it doesn't seem to last. Lasting happiness comes from something else. And so, yes, so the problem isn't that we're not work in it. It's that we have these misconceptions about the kinds of things that are really going to make us feel better. But, you know, we really need, we need some like work to figure out the right sorts of things that will make us feel good.
  Speaker 2
  So the way i think of people like this, i call them happy if, or happy when people. Cause they're not happy in the moment, they're happy when something, when i get a promotion, when i get a relationship, when i get a new car, when i get a new house, i'll be happy then. And then, why is it that we never seem to be happy when that happens? Ye, this. ([Time 0:04:48](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f84e9aba-73df-43ed-bb2d-282565436f7d))
- The Effect of Reference Group on Income Perception
  Key takeaways:
  (* Our brains are biased towards comparing ourselves to our reference group, which can lead to feelings of selfdoubt., * Our reference group can change a lot over time, which can make it difficult to compare ourselves to previous achievements.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Is it because our reference group changes silic if, if you're a you get a promotion, all the sudden you're comparing yourself against your, your new leagues instead of your old colleague.
  Speaker 1
  Yes, there there's kind of two bises. One is this reference group bias, right? Which is that, you know, our brains are just not built to pay attention to anything objectively, right? We just pay attention relative to stuff. So, he how much money should you earn? You don't have like, an objective number. You have like, you know, im, i'm a professor an an iv leag institution likewel, i should earn about as much as other, you know, professors at ivy league institutions, like you're a podcaster, you're probably thinking, i know how much should you earn? Like, ell, yo, wht is the average pod o, where's a good pod caster earn? I kind o want to earn that rite. Youso, we never think in objective terms. We're always thinking relative to something. And that what we think of as our reference point changes pretty quickly, you know, soon as you become, you know, a millionaire, and now your reference point isn't, you know, you know, what i was earning in grad school, ie, now your reference point is like other millionaires. And you might not be as rich as other millionaires, right? They might have a better yacht than you, or a better vacation house than you. And what's, what's a dumb thing about our minds is that we never look to reference ints that make us feel good. We always look to reference points that make us feel, they make us feel crappy. You know, i'm, i was n doing some consulting with with basket ball team, and i was going through, you know, hey, what's your reference point for, you know, what's a good basketball player's salary?
