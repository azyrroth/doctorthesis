## Highlights
- The Best Advice Graham Green Gives Joel and Ellie
  Key takeaways:
  (* Henry and Sam's relationship was ended in a tragic way and the audience is reminded of it and given a timeline of when things happened., * Joel and Ellie have been going through a process of mourning and there is not yet an intense grief., * The characters meet new people and learn about their situation.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, we first wanted to remind people, even though it's only been a week, about how things ended between Henry and Sam. When you end an episode with a tragedy the way episode five ends, the most important thing is that you let the audience know that you're aware of it and you're going to honor it. It was important for us to say we're remembering this and also a lot of time has now passed. It was important to give the audience an understanding that Joel and Ellie have been going for a while. And so they are not still in direct mourning over what happened. There isn't this immediate grief. Although of course we will see that grief burble back up soon.
  Speaker 3
  We've gone from Boston to Kansas City to geographically now. Where are we in the world?
  Speaker 1
  Wyoming.
  Speaker 2
  But where in Wyoming they are is still something they're trying to figure out. Not a small place. No. This is kind of similar in the game. They knew they were getting close but they weren't going to know exactly where they were.
  Speaker 3
  This is where we get to meet some new characters, the ininitable Graham Green and also his wife played by Elaine Miles. And Graham's character gives us some great advice.
  Speaker 5
  Anywhere people used to be, you can't go there no more. So you haven't heard the name Tommy? Nope.
  Speaker 6
  What about the fireflies? We get those in the summer. Not the bugs, the people. There are firefly people?
  Speaker 5
  He got any advice on the best way west? ([Time 0:01:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ebfa2b4c-a7ab-497d-a2de-874c76ffce8f))
- The Road to Becoming Comfortable with Each Other
  Key takeaways:
  (* Joel and Ellie have progressed in their relationship since the end of the last episode., * Joel is having a panic attack, and he doesn't know why.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  My understanding of them is that they left well before the outbreak ever started. When the world ended, they were already off the grid. So they have cordoned themselves off permanently from everything. And even more so, by their concern about the things they've seen, they've reduced their world down to this cabin and a certain amount of area they can go, but you don't go west of the river.
  Speaker 2
  And it's interesting, I think, for fans of the game, especially part two, as it shows you can survive. If you find like a quiet corner, there are still safe areas. It's not just all doom and gloom and danger around every corner. It does exist, but you can survive there on your own. I think there's also, we would talk a lot about not exhausting our audience. And we just traumatized them with the end of the last episode. So this was a moment of levity, a moment to show how Joel and Ellie have progressed in their relationship. They're much more comfortable with each other. And a lot of our conversation about this episode were like, what is the impact on Joel from the experience of Henry and Sam? And you get to see some of that as they exit the cabin and he seizes his chest.
  Speaker 3
  So what is going on there?
  Speaker 1
  What's happening is Joel's having a panic attack and he doesn't know why. Panic attacks feel very much like heart attacks. It's your body telling you you're in terrible danger, but you don't understand yet why. ([Time 0:04:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7487be66-c1d5-45e1-a8f6-8b4fdeacd07e))
- The Cold
  Key takeaways:
  (* Joel and Ellie are both struggling to process their emotions and to be emotionally honest with each other., * Joel is upset because he fears that he will get his brother killed in the cold weather.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And I also love Ellie's reaction here, which is, you know, when you look at your parents that have been protecting your entire life, you don't want to accept that they have any sort of weakness. So she's getting angry with him, which I felt this as well. You know, sometimes my parents get older. I was like, I don't know why that's the reaction, but you get angry that they're not invincible. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  If you die, I'm fucked. Is what she says to him, which is, I think, a very child thing to say. Obviously, she also cannot process what that would emotionally be like. Neither one of them are operating on the level of emotional honesty or acceptance yet because they can't get there. What they are doing is doing what Joel and Ellie do. Ellie is coming at this from the point of view of being this child who's saying, don't die because I need you to stay alive. She's certainly not going to say don't die because I love you. And Joel is not saying I'm terrified that I'm going to get you killed. And that's why I'm so upset. Instead, his heart is seizing up on him and he can't even explain why. It's the cold. Yeah, he says it's just the cold air.
  Speaker 5
  It's the cold air. ([Time 0:07:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/079b5b36-f1d7-4311-a8d9-cb44947ae456))
- The Wistful Ellie
  Key takeaways:
  (* Ellie has a newfound interest in being an astronaut after seeing Neil Armstrong's historic spaceflight in the second game of the Last of Us series., * This newfound interest is likely due to her upbringing in the QZ, a place where she has access to both ocean and a wall that gives her a view of the world beyond.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 5
  It's the cold air.
  Speaker 3
  So after Joel has this episode, this panic attack, we then transition into Ellie staring up at the Aurora Borealis by the campfire. And she's talking about this is the first time we've really seen her become wistful and maybe even hopeful. She talks about her desire to be an astronaut.
  Speaker 6
  It's probably because I grew up in the QZ. Behind you, there's ocean and the head of you, there's a wall or else to look what up. I read everything I could in the school library. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell, you know who my favorite is?
  Speaker 4
  Sally Ride.
  Speaker 6
  Sally fucking Ride. Best astronaut name ever.
  Speaker 3
  Where did that come from?
  Speaker 1
  When I first started working with Neil on this adaptation, it was before the Last of Us 2 had come out and I went over to... It was the first time I'd ever gone over to Naughty Dog and sat with him there. And he said, you want to see something from the second game? And I was like, yeah. And he showed me a sequence from the second game that touches on Ellie's interest and fascination with being an astronaut in space travel. And it's an incredibly beautiful moment. And that's one of those times where I said, hey, we have this opportunity that Neil didn't have when he was making the first game, which is we know more. ([Time 0:08:17](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bdb515b2-c10f-4a45-b6f5-d32c9e4ce8cc))
- The Strange Reaction of Joel to Ellie
  Key takeaways:
  (* Ellie and Joel were getting along well until Joel started to get pushback from Maria., * Joel became protective of his tribe and family and tried to push Maria out., * There was a nice Easter egg that was ambiguous.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  What happened to you?
  Speaker 2
  When they sit down to eat, after they get the tour of the place, there's some really nice stuff that's happening there. Ellie's just like, has a sailor mouth and Joel being like a good old Texan is like apologizing for her manners. What?
  Speaker 6
  What's wrong with you? What about her manners? She was just curious.
  Speaker 4
  Kids around here don't usually look or talk like you, right? Well, maybe I'll teach them.
  Speaker 9
  And I want my gun back.
  Speaker 4
  They also aren't armed. You know what? I think maybe you all got a little off on the wrong foot.
  Speaker 6
  She's going to have her guys kill us.
  Speaker 4
  Well, you got to be real careful about who we let in this place.
  Speaker 2
  But then, you know, when he starts getting this pushback from Maria, all of a sudden he's like, he gets very protective of his tribe, his family's like, and he's trying to push her out and then realizing, no, no, this is someone Tommy has led into the circle without his permission. So he has just a weird kind of reaction to it. And then there's like a nice kind of what you call an Easter egg. I don't know if I'd call it an Easter egg.
  Speaker 1
  It's a little, I mean, it's ambiguous. Somebody's staring at Ellie, which is wonderful. That could be theoretically or not. We'll find out how you want. Oh, I completely missed that. What are you looking at? Yeah. ([Time 0:16:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/592a8537-a656-4f2e-9dee-45ad5d9d3361))
- The Confrontation
  Key takeaways:
  (* Ellie is not happy with Joel and Maria because they have a bad reputation., * Joel realizes this the first time they talk.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  That doesn't mean that that's Dina doesn't mean it's not. How interesting. I was what because the question that I was going to ask is why is Ellie being so confrontational here? Well, Ellie's tribe is Joel and Ellie has been taking a little bit of the lead ever since they've gotten to Wyoming. And what she knows is they were captured by these people. Guns were pointed at them. They were threatened with dogs. And supposedly they're killing people because Marlon and Florence told them. So she's not happy.
  Speaker 2
  I think Ellie can smell what's happening here, which is there's something around with Maria where she doesn't like Joel. Yes. Ellie can sense that. Yes.
  Speaker 1
  She knows when Maria says, you know, bad reputation doesn't mean you're bad or Tommy says that and Maria says not always at least. That's when Joel realizes, but now he got it the first bounce. We should say this episode was directed by Yasmino Zbonich, who is a brilliant Bosnian filmmaker. She made this wonderful movie called Quovada Saeda. And Yasmino grew up in Sarajevo in the middle of the war. Wow. When we were talking to her about directing an episode, I said, look, we have these two episodes that take place in war, torn Kansas City. It's a city that has been divided. It is essentially erupted into a civil war who would know how to better do this than you. ([Time 0:18:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9af36c69-97b4-4bb6-ba7a-8fdeefce4b79))
- All Gone
  Key takeaways:
  (* The music in the game and series can be used to help evoke a feeling of loss and sadness., * This loss is related to the character's relationship with Sarah.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's very specific, you know, when you see it and here's this other woman, a grown woman, but he's looking at her from behind. She's got that hair and it's, and, and this, this wonderful thing that Pedro does, he's blinking a lot, which we do when we're under stress. We tend to blink a lot. And so he's having this panic attack and his eyes are blinking and then he looks and he sees this woman and he stops blinking and he just stares and he stops having a panic attack. He goes into something else. He's daydreaming. He goes, it's not her, but it could be her. And then this little girl runs over and it's like, and that could be my granddaughter. Yeah. That's another life. And then the woman turns and it's not Sarah. And suddenly he feels like the biggest idiot, like the most hopeless fool that this is what he's still doing after 20 years. This is the moment where I think there is a snap in him, a break that will allow him finally to just tell his brother the truth.
  Speaker 3
  There is a particular cue from the score by our composer Gustavo Santelaya called All Gone. That's repeated quite often throughout both the game and the series. And whenever it comes on, I think about loss and it all starts with Sarah.
  Speaker 2
  I think beautiful scores and scores that are used well, it's a way into the subconscious. ([Time 0:24:21](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c2123698-f2e2-43eb-b04f-ef809ed91fc9))

- The Unspoken Truth
  Key takeaways:
  (* Joel is afraid that if he doesn't do the scene, Tommy will think that Joel doesn't care about him., * Joel is also afraid that if he does the scene, Tommy will think that Joel is sexualizing him.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 5
  He knows the area better than I do. Do you give a shit about me or not?
  Speaker 6
  Of course I do. Then what are you so afraid of? I'm not her, you know. Maria told me about Sarah and... No.
  Speaker 5
  Don't say another word.
  Speaker 4
  Let's talk about that scene.
  Speaker 1
  This is one of those moments that I have sense memory of, you know, playing the game and just being shocked. This is a spot where, I mean, even in an episode where we are in Jackson which wasn't in the game and Joel has said a lot of very different things to Tommy that weren't in the game. This is one of those moments where I said I want to, with rare exception, we're doing the scene because the scene is great. I want the wallpaper to be the same. I want her sitting where she was sitting. I want her reading the diary and I want to feel all of it. I think with two exceptions, one at the end where he says, you know, come dawn and then one that I'm sure you want to ask about was just mighty thin ice. It's the same scene. ([Time 0:36:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a2bb5813-930c-4a59-9d73-1b2d8becccab))
- Don't Tell Me That I'd Be Safe With Somebody Else
  Key takeaways:
  (* The don't in Pedro's and what it was, it wasn't a threat again. He's pleading. It's almost the same. Please don't that he gave to the sniper. It's the exact same thing., * The scene doesn't change the subtext of your treading on mighty thin ice. And don't don't say another word. The context is exactly the same. Stop in your tracks. Turn around. Go back., * Ellie does not. Ellie moves forward, physically moves forward.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  The don't in Pedro's and what it was, it wasn't a threat again. He's pleading. It's almost the same. Please don't that he gave to the sniper. It's the exact same thing.
  Speaker 1
  And the scene doesn't change the subtext of your treading on mighty thin ice. And don't don't say another word. The context is exactly the same. Stop in your tracks. Turn around. Go back. And in both scenes, Ellie does not. Ellie moves forward, physically moves forward.
  Speaker 3
  And if I'm not mistaken also, everyone has left me except for you.
  Speaker 5
  Was the original line.
  Speaker 1
  Fucking except for you. And what I love about that is the imperfection of it. That's not where the word fucking belongs normally syntactically. Which shows you that Ashley was just in the moment, right? Because we are not perfect when we speak. And if I had ridden that line and looked at it, I'd be like, ah, that moved it around. Of course. Exactly. You would never write it like that. But it's perfect the way it is. So that was perfectly replicable. And it was important to me that we do it.
  Speaker 6
  Everybody I have cared for has either died or left me.
  Speaker 7
  Everybody fucking except for you. So don't tell me that I'd be safe with somebody else because the truth is I would just be more scared. ([Time 0:38:39](https://share.snipd.com/snip/13934ae5-1f71-4bfa-b08b-3f1d65cba7e6))
- The Lie That Binds
  Key takeaways:
  (* For the protagonist, the performance was a rejection of the dream, the ideal., * However, it is too late and the fact that he thinks about his own daughter right after that shows that he can't walk away., * The line about choice is interesting because it shows that he is doing himself a favor by staying.)
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  For me in that moment, then that performance, what I got is I am rejecting the dream, the ideal.
  Speaker 1
  But once again, he is lying. Yeah. He's lying. He, it is technically correct. He wants it to be true. He feels like if I just say that and walk away, I have saved myself from pain and despair. But it's too late. It's too late and the fact that he thinks about his own daughter right after that is not and that is my real daughter. Therefore I've made the right decision. It's more like I have the same feeling. I can't walk away. I can't. He tries. Next morning he tries and he just can't do it. And what he says to Ellie is you deserve a choice. Now that's a cop out.
  Speaker 3
  Right. That's a total cop. He's a mess by the way in democracy and is a noble gesture. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  Which by the way, I don't know how to say this without spoiling something, but it's like that line specifically is very interesting to where the story goes. Yes, I agree.
  Speaker 1
  It is. It will echo back later on the notion of choice. But it here is a lie. He's not there because he has a choice. He's not doing her a favor. He's doing himself a favor. He can't leave. He can't. ([Time 0:40:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ae430176-c20c-4d88-b3e6-532e51c4cc2e))
